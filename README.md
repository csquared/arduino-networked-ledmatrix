# Deployers Arduino Code

Check out [my writeup](http://chriscontinanza.com/2013/05/29/Heroku-Deploys.html) for more context.

## Install
Be sure to install [ArduinoHTTPLib](https://github.com/csquared/arduino-http).

Then just download this repository to your Sketchbook directory.
On OS X, mine is `~/Documents/Arduino/`.

For Hardware I have an Arduino UNO and Ethernet Shield.
